**Pharmaceutical marketing**

Pharmaceutical marketing refers to the marketing of drugs, it designs
all the drug promotions activities. The aim of these activities is to
inform the physician about the drug , to generate interest, to persuade
him to evaluate and try to prescribe this drugs in order to obtain a
repeated prescription.

Unawareness. ........ Awareness.......... Interest ............
Evaluation ........ Trial ........ Use ....... Repeat \[7\].

The marketing strategies adopted the pharmaceutical industry contrast
sharply with those used in other markets. The decision maker is the
"physicians" who prescribes the drug between alternatives and the end
user is the patient who pays for the prescribed drugs \[5\]. On average,
pharmaceutical industries spent 20% or more of their sales on marketing
which made them a lot of money.

**Prescribing decisions**

Prescribing decisions are a complex process where the physician chooses
one drug over another within the same active ingredient. Different
factors influence the prescribing decision, some of these factors are
pharmacological factors and others are non pharmacological factors.

According to study conducted in Yemen (2013), factors affecting the
prescribing decision were grouped according to indications, patient
context , drug characteristics, pharmaceutical company, information and
evidence and physician factors (experience of medication, prefer local
company and curious of drugs). In addition, physicians mentioned the
reasons for not prescribing a selective medication to deal with other
companies and the obligations to prescribe a particular drug.\[3\]

**Promotional activities**

[The traditional form of promotional spending in US (2004)
\[7\]]{.underline}:

-Unmotired promotion

\- E promotion, mailing, trials

\- Journal ads

\- Meeting

\- DTCA ( direct to consumer advertising)

\- Samples

\- Sales representatives

[Unconventional forms of Pharmaceutical marketing:]{.underline}

-Funding of Key Opinion Leader

-Public Relations Campaigns including unbranding " disease-oriented"
ads.

**Medical Representative**

Medical representatives play a vital role in pharmaceutical marketing.
According to study realized in New Zealand (1994), medical
representatives are the source of prescribing information for general
practitioners. Different research has shown the reasons for doctors
accepting medical representatives visits; first to be aware of newly
launched medication, second to obtain samples, third to obtain gifts or
for social aspect.

It has proven that the doctors who obtain medical information from
representatives are less rational prescribers than those who obtain this
information from a colleague \[9\]. In addition, there is good evidence
that the information provided by medical representatives is incomplete
and biased towards the products being marketed \[7\].

In other hand, a research in Iraq reveals that specialist physicians
were visited by 1-3 Medical representatives per day and the number of
medical representatives visits is proportional to the number of patients
in the doctor\'s clinic.\[11\]

**Samples**

Free samples offered to physicians have several purposes; \[5\]

\- Samples can be the only visible reminder of the product

-Samples can have a lasting influence on the physicians because they add
tangibility on the medical presentation and the acceptance of samples
imply some commitment to prescribe the product in the future.

-Samples mitigate the effect of increased price sensitivity.

According to Lurker and Caprara (2005), samples are given to patients
who have been diagnosed with a condition to confirm the efficacy and
tolerability of the drug or to patients without medical coverage and may
be unable to pay for a selective drug.\[1\] Furthmore, the marginal cost
of providing an extra unit of detailing information is often much more
than the marginal cost of a sample drop.\[1\]

Gönül et al. (2001) and r et al. (2004) show that detailing and sampling
have a positive impact on physician prescriptions.

**Gifts**

Gifts no matter their size, have a powerful effect on human
relationships. Reciprocity is a strong guiding principle of human
interaction. DeJong et al has shown that a meal with a value of less
than \$20 can increase the prescribing of branded statins,
beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, and antidepressants.\[14\]

According to study conducted in Saudi Arabia(281 participants), reasons
for accepting gifts offers are:

-Human nature (44,9%)

-Do not want to say no (32,4%)

-Helps me to remember the product (28,9%)

-Minor gifts are always welcomed (26,2%)

-Gifts are present in every profession (15,6%)

-Salaries of doctors are inadequate (4%)

-Other reasons (10,2%)

And the type of gifts accepted;

-Samples (58,2%)

-Stationary such as pens or notepads (52,9%)

-Free meals (37,8%)

-Attending CME events (33,3%)

-Industry-sponsored events (20,4%)

-Non-Industry-sponsored events (21,3)

-Prepaid promotion cards (7,1%)

-Funded research (5,8%)

Two study confirm that the gifts offered to the doctors have a greater
effect on prescribing patterns; first study realized in French (41257
participants in 2016) reveals that French general practitioners who do
not receive gifts from pharmaceutical companies have better drug
prescription efficiency indicators and less costly drug prescription
than general practitioner s who receive gifts.\[2\]

Second study conducted in Columbia (2873 participants in 2017) confirms
that industry gifts are associated with more expensive prescriptions and
more branded prescriptions. Prescribers who received gifts wrote an
average of two more prescriptions per patient, compared to prescribers
who did not receive gifts. \[6\]

**Digital Marketing**

Pharmaceutical firms need to prioritize digital marketing strategies to
beat the highly competitive Business environment.

Digital marketing is applied in pharmaceutical marketing in various
forms:

-   Website of Pharmaceutical industry

-   Emails

-   Online shopping

-   Pharma application

-   Advertising

-   Use of IPad during medical representatives visits
